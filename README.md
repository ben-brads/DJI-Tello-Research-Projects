# DJI-Tello-Research-Projects

I had a great time working with the Tello this semester!
The videos I'm uploading will be for the programs I thought deserved a video.
The one that took me the longest was the hydroflask finder, as I had to teach myself about threading to do it,
the facetracking and mapping come from various cv2 tutorials I followed.
