# DJI-Tello-Research-Projects

I had a great time working with the Tello this semester!

Programs:

BasicMovements - What I spent my first time on, just trying to connect to the Drone with the wrapper (which took longer than I expected) and getting it to fly around and land.

FaceTracking - Uses a cv2 haar cascade and follows closest detectable person's face.  This one I figured out how to do following tutorials on cv2 and the drone and a lot of trial and error. (Video Uploaded)

HydroFlaskFinder - This is the one I'm proudest of and took the longest as I did all of it entirely through trial and error on my own.  Figuring out how
to use the mission pads was tough and I also had to learn threading to pass tello commands while it searches for a water bottle, then lands once it finds it. (Video Uploaded)

KeyBoardControl - My first attempt at controlling the drone from my pc with the KeyPress Module.

Mapping - This one doesn't work great, it uses pygame to map points on a screen as you press keys to control it.

Spy_Drone - One of my favorite things I did and had a lot of fun with, flys with pc input and pushes video and allows you to save images that save to a resources folder in my PyCharm project.

The rest of the files are resources I used for the others.

Thanks for the oppurtunity!
